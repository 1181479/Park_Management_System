## Working methodology ##

In our team, we have adopted an agile working methodology to achieve  the needs of our project. Our approach leverages the Scrum framework, supported by Bitbucket for version control and Jira for the management of epics and user stories.

Within Scrum, the defined roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team ensure well-defined responsibilities. We utilize Jira to create and track epics and user stories, ensuring that everyone has a clear view of objectives and tasks.

The choice of Scrum, Bitbucket, and Jira is highly suitable for our development environment. Scrum enables us to effectively manage changing requirements through iterative deliveries and close collaboration with our clients. Bitbucket provides a robust solution for version control, ensuring efficient code management. Jira is a versatile tool for task definition, tracking, and management, perfectly aligning with our project's needs.

We employ short-duration sprints within Scrum, allowing us to reassess priorities at the end of each iteration. If new information or client requirements emerge, we can easily add or adjust user stories, preserving the flexibility of our process.

Continuous evaluation is an integral component of our methodology. After each sprint, we conduct retrospectives to identify areas for improvement. Based on these assessments, we improve our process to continually enhance efficiency and the quality of our work. 

## Definition of Ready and Done ##

* **Ready** - The user story needs to be clear (all team members must understand what it means), testable (there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected) and feasible (can be completed in one sprint, according to the Definition of Done). At this point the user story is ready to enter the sprint.
* **Done** - The user story meets all requirements and acceptance criteria. The code is integrated into the main codebase, reviewed and tested. The documentation and user guides are updated accordingly. The product owner or stakeholder has approved the work.

## Product Vision ##

Our mission is to revolutionize the parking experience through an innovative park operations management system that prioritizes seamless and customer-focused interactions. We are committed to creating a personalized system for each one of our registered customers, moving away from traditional ticketing methods towards a more simpler and loyalty-driven approach.

Our system ensures a smooth entry and exit process without the need for physical tickets. Users can park effortlessly, receive personalized welcome messages, and earn PARKY coins that can be used for future parking. These coins can be accumulated through activities such as registering for the app, using our parks, and referrals for new users, fostering loyalty and continuous engagement.

To cater to electric and GPL vehicle owners, our system provides real-time availability of dedicated parking spots through a user-friendly parking app. The app supports multiple languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish) and adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG), ensuring a inclusive experience for all users.

Security and compliance are also one of our top priorities. We implement industry-standard security measures, including two-factor authentication, to protect customer data and ensure secure and reliable transactions.

In summary, our product vision aims to build a customer-centric, technologically advanced, and secure park operations management system. Our goal is to improve satisfaction and convenience, ultimately reshaping the way people perceive and engage with parking facilities.

## High-level scope of Sprint ##

For Sprint 1, we have prioritized certain functionalities to deliver a simplified version of the product, focusing on meeting our customer's basic needs.
The selected epics for this sprint were:

* Add a park;
* Customer registration;
* Payment method management;
* Add a vehicle;
* List nearby parks and availability;
* Simulate park gate opening;
* Display to show welcome, goodbye and park availability messages;
* Simulate park gate closing;

For the application to function, these features don't need to be 100% complete,so we've aimed for the essential and fundamental aspects. Concerning the parks, they will be manually added to the database. Customer and vehicle registrations won't have validations, such as verifying ID card numbers or car registration validity. Only one payment method will be available. The listing of nearby parks will be done through enumeration without the aid of a map. We will simulate park gate operations and the messages displayed will include information about park availability, entrances and exits.

## Architecture and Technologies ##

![Logical View - Level 2](diagrams/LogicalView.jpg)

* **Website** - Features a promotional landing page displaying commercial information and provides links for downloading the app.

* **Mobile Application** - Designed for park users facilitates tasks such as registering customers and their vehicles, managing personal information, payment methods, adding or changing vehicles, checking activity logs, monitoring outstanding payments, displaying nearby park maps indicating available parking spots, handling monthly subscriptions, offering parking suggestions based on current traffic and user habits, checking PARKY wallet, inviting other users, viewing notifications, and enabling account cancellation.

* **CarPlateReader System** - Software simulation that focuses on reading license plates accurately and returning the plate data to the central system. It should include a RESTful API for communication and a frontend component for the actual plate reading.

* **Barrier System** - Software simulation that involves creating a separate system to manage parking barriers effectively. It should simulate the time it takes for the barrier to open and close, provide a frontend interface for manual control, and offer an API for interaction with other parts of the system.

* **Park Display System** - This component provides real-time information to users by displaying the current status of the parking facility at the entrance. It should offer an API for updating the displayed text to convey information about availability or full capacity.

* **BackOffice** - Component that involves the Park management, Customer management and Parky Wallet management. Managing the park involves setting up its configurations such as locations, floors, and various types of parking spots, appointing managers, controlling price tables, enabling or disabling parking spots temporarily, monitoring real-time occupancy, and generating reports on parking usage. Additionally, handling customer affairs includes identifying those with pending payments, the ability to block customers on a temporary or permanent basis, categorizing customers based on their park usage and outstanding payment status, sending individual or bulk messages to customers (e.g., for updates on price table changes), and managing the PARKY wallet by defining thresholds, providing reports and analytics, and distributing PARKY coins in bulk to users.

* **BackOffice UI** - Interface that is made available for all the sub-components that represent the BackOffice component.

* **External Payment Service** - Software for simulating a partnership with SIBS/Mbway.

* **Sensor** -  component responsible for checking the proximity of vehicles.

### Technologies that will be used ###
